### Brief Summary of Project
This project aims to empower and enhance the wellbeing of young people with disabilities including intellectual disabilities, between the ages of 15-35 years by providing access to in-demand technology skills, fostering inclusive communities through awareness, research, advocacy, and promoting safe spaces in Kano State through the following objectives: 
Significantly empower young people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, between the ages of 15-35 years by equipping them with in-demand technology skills such as data analytics, web development, and geographic information systems through targeted training programs tailored to meet the specific needs of participants.
Create public awareness for effective social inclusion for people with intellectual disabilities
Provide grant research into prevalence of intellectual disabilities in communities in Kano (various disabilities)
Create a safe environment for young people with intellectual disabilities
These 3 principles underpins the implementation of this project:
Person-Centered Approach: The project prioritizes the needs and preferences of young people with disabilities, ensuring their active participation in all aspects of the project.
Accessibility and Inclusion: The project is committed to creating accessible and inclusive environments and activities for individuals with diverse disabilities.
Collaboration and Partnerships: The project works in collaboration with a variety of stakeholders, including disability organizations, government agencies, development partners, educators, and policymakers for sustainability and wider impact.
### Project Relevance and Justification 
Context Rational: Brief summary on the specific context that relates to this project. 
According to Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2018, an estimated 7% of household members aged 5 or above have some level of difficulty in at least one functional domain:  seeing, hearing, communication, cognition, walking, or self-care while 1% either have a lot of difficulty or cannot function at all in at least one domain. Persons with disabilities encounter attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their full, equal, and effective participation in the society. As a result, they are more likely to experience adverse socioeconomic outcomes and higher rates of multidimensional poverty than the general population.  However, disability-related data are sparse due government’s low prioritization of collecting disability-disaggregated data.				
This project directly aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 1 (Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities); also with African Union Agenda 2063, Goal 1 of providing a high standard of living, quality of life, and well being for all citizens. Specifically support efforts to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education; also reduce inequalities by empowering marginalized groups. This ties with Nigeria's commitment on advancement and promotion of disability rights, inclusion, and well-being of persons with disabilities. 
The project is highly relevant to promoting social inclusion and upholding the human rights of people with disabilities through awareness creation, advocating for their rights, and establishing safe spaces. The proposed interventions will help to break barriers leading to a more inclusive and equitable society where people with intellectual disability can participate in community life hence reducing isolation and improving overall quality of life. Furthemore, involving parents and caregivers in advocating for the rights of their children is essential to creating sustainable and sustained change. 
Conducting research on the prevalence of intellectual disabilities will provide a data-driven approach of using the findings to inform program design and policy advocacy ensuring that the implementation  is evidence-based and tailored to the specific needs of the target population in Kano State. This data-driven approach will maximize the impact of the intervention and ensure that resources are allocated effectively.
Kano State faces significant socio-economic challenges, including high rates of unemployment and poverty, particularly among marginalized populations such as young people with disabilities. Consequently, those with intellectual disabilities are disproportionately affected by these challenges, further exacerbating existing inequalities. In recent years, the global economy is increasingly driven by technology. Therefore, providing access to in-demand technology skills positions young people with disabilities to participate in the digital economy and take advantage of emerging opportunities in sectors such as data analytics, web development, and geographic information systems to enhance their employability and participation in community development.
### Problem Statement: 
Young people with disabilities in Nigeria, particularly those with intellectual disabilities are a marginalized group facing significant and systemic barriers to full participation and inclusion in the society. 				
### Underlying issues: 
The underlying issues that this project will address include: limited access to economic opportunity, persistent social exclusion, inadequate data for decision making, and insufficient safe and supportive environment.
- Limited Access to Economic Opportunity: A significant gap exists in access to industry-relevant skills and training for young people with disabilities, especially those with intellectual disabilities. Most often they are largely excluded from the burgeoning technology sector and other high-growth industries, perpetuating cycles of poverty and dependence. 
- Persistent Social Exclusion: Despite growing awareness of disability rights, social inclusion for people with intellectual disabilities remains inadequate. Negative stereotypes, lack of understanding, and inaccessible environments continue to foster social isolation and limit opportunities for meaningful engagement in community life. This exclusion has detrimental effects on their mental health, well-being, and overall quality of life. 
- Inadequate Data and Research: There is a critical lack of comprehensive data and research on the prevalence of intellectual disabilities among individuals with various disabilities within Nigeria. This absence of evidence-based information hinders the development of targeted policies, effective interventions, and appropriate resource allocation to address the specific needs of this population. 
- Insufficient Safe and Supportive Environments: Young people with intellectual disabilities  often lack safe and supportive spaces where they can build social connections, develop essential life skills, and access necessary support services. Consequently, increases their vulnerability to exploitation, abuse, and mental health challenges, further marginalizing them from mainstream society. 
The above-mentioned interconnected challenges limit the potential of young people with disabilities, hinder their contributions to the society, and undermine the African Union 2063 broader goals of equity and social justice. Addressing these problems is not only a matter of human rights but also strategic in building a more inclusive and prosperous community for all. In overall, the  lack of adequate support and opportunities for young people with disabilities represents a significant loss of human potential and economic productivity.

If young people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, between the ages of 15-35 years are readily available to learn the market-relevant tech skills then their knowledge will be  improved.
If the young people with disabilities complete the relevant courses, then their employability skills will increase.
If the employment opportunities are available and the employers are aware of equal opportunities for people with disabilities; those with an increased capacity can have access to employment or become an entrepreneur.
If there is stakeholder buy-in with an enabling environment, then the project will have greater community acceptance and more young people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities will be reached hence sustainability.
If there is availability of resources, more young people with disabilities will be covered.
If there is no disruption of the implementation by external factors such as insurgence, conflict, policy changes, economic conditions, societal attitudes then the project timeline will be observed.

## The Theory of Change (ToC) framework 
Used for this proposal is adapted from the Social Model of Disability which holds that society is responsible for accommodating disabled people and removing barriers to their inclusion. The project will create change through a multi-pronged approach:
- Skills & Employability: Equip young people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, with in-demand technology skills addressing barriers to accessing employment and economic independence which can lead to increased self-sufficiency and greater sense of purpose.
- Awareness & Inclusion: The public awareness campaign shifts attitudes and behaviours towards people with intellectual disability fostering a more inclusive society resulting in greater acceptance, reduced discrimination, and increased opportunities for social participation.
- Data & Knowledge: The research on the prevalence of intellectual disability will provide crucial data for informed decision-making and targeted resource allocation for more effective programs and policies to meet the specific needs of this population.
- Safe Environments: The creation of safe spaces provides a supportive and empowering environment for young people with intellectual disability which fosters social connection, reduces isolation, promotes mental health and well-being for sustainability.
